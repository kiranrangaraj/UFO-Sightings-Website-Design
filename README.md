## Summary ##

A website was created to organize extra-terrestrial eye-witness reports from January 1st - 13th, 2010 into a table that dynamically updates based on filters a user inputs for specific values. The website was built using JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and D3.js.

## Process ##

### Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page.

* Used the UFO Sightings data set in the form of an array of JavaScript objects to append a table to the web page and added new rows of data for each of UFO sighting.

* Created columns for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment`.

* Used a date form in the HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that listens for events and searches through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Level 2: Multiple Search Categories

* Used multiple user `input` tags, and wrote JavaScript code for the user to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
